## Packages
framer-motion | For complex card animations, drag gestures, and page transitions
canvas-confetti | For the falling hearts animation
lucide-react | Icons (already in base, but listing for completeness)

## Notes
The app requires a highly interactive card interface.
We will use Framer Motion for the drag-to-open gesture and page turning effects.
Canvas confetti will handle the "raining hearts" effect on Page 1.
The backend API provides message content, but we'll have fallbacks if the API is empty to ensure the specific text requested is shown.
